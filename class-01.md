# Process & Design

You should start by knowing who's your audience, why they use your site, and what information they look to find. Don't forget to start after that with a site maps to allow you to plan the structure of a site. You also need to use wireframes to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is a way of communication with your audience. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. Finally, by using size, color, and style you make the differentiation between pieces of information easier. 

# HTML5 Layout

 HTML5 elements are a way to indicate the purpose of different parts inside a web page. The new elements provide clearer code. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. HTML5 elements don't work in IE8.
 
 # A Script in JS

* A  script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in  order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
