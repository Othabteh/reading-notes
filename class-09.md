## HTML Chapter 7 *(Forms)*

Forms refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site. Some of the form controls are:
  - Text input
  - Password input
  - Text area 
  - Radio buttons
  - Checkoxes
  - Drop down boxes
  - Submit buttons

This how forms work:
1. The user fill in a form and presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the valie the user entered. (name/value pairs).
3. The server processes the information using a programming language.
4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser on the information received. 

## HTML Chapter 14 *(List, Tables, Forms)*

- List markers can be given different appearances using list-style-type and list-style-image properties. 
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

## JavaScript Chapter 6 *(Events)*

Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened. When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JS function. When this function changes the web page, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 

HTML elements nest insie other elements. If you hover or click on a link, you will also be hovering or clicking on its parent elements.
