## JavaScript Chapter 3 *(Functions, Methods, and Objects)* 
### Functions
A series of statements group together to perform a specific task. A method is the same as function, except they are created inside (and are part of) an object. Functions can be reuse and eliminates the need to write repetitive code. Functions won't run unless they are called. This improves browser and computer performance. When you call a returns the function's value. 

- Declaring a function:
  >a) Function keyword: **function** <br>
  >b) Function name: **welcomeMessage( )** <br>
  >c) Code code inside curly braces: **{ code goes here }** 
  >d) Some function may need specific information to perform a task. This information is passed to the function as parameters: **function getArea(width, height) { return width * height; }**

- Calling a function 
  >a) you use the function name: **welcomeMessage( );**
  >b) if function has parameters: **getArea(3, 5)** These are the values for parameters in the function. Functions can return more than one value using an array.
